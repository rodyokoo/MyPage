							<h3>a better day</h3>
							<p><a>I couldn't sleep well last night. Maybe because I started this project.
								But today was a good and funny day at work. I had some regular conversations with my co-workers
								 and everything was fine. I went to the Jiu-Jitsu gym after work today. It was a nogi session. 
								 And that was pretty tough. Maybe it was that tough because I couldn't sleep well.

							<h3>not a good wake up</h3>
							<p><a>Like every single Monday, that was not a good day at work. But was 
								a good day at English Class and when I arrived the 
								Jiu-Jitsu Class, everything goes fine. And I finaly start this blog. I don't know when
								I will upload this page, but I'm working on it.
