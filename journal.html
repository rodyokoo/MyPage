							<h3>Carnival Monday</h3>
							<p>
								<a>
									It's a Holiday in Brazil, I went to the dentist to tear off the wisdom teeth last Friday. So, I couldn't train. 
									I will spend these days off playing some video games and studying.

							<h3>That was a flu</h3>
							<p>
								<a>
									Last week I trained just in Tuesday, I was sick, that was a flu. Ferver, that water inside the nose. But I'm back, and 
									my Jiu Jitsu Professor kicked my ass today. There's a tournament in 3 weeks and he want me to train at the advanced 
									group today, but I am really tired. That was funny.

							<h3>Lazy mondays</h3>
							<p>
								<a>
									That's something common, everybody are lazy in Mondays, include me. But I skipped BJJ training last Monday and today. 
									I'm thinking in how can I fix it. Maybe sleeping early in Sundays.
								</a>

							<h3>Rest day</h3>
							<p>
								<a>
									Today is my day off. I just eat and rest, I don't even play video game. But yesterday was a wild day. I did my exams to register myself in CBJJ and trained at 11am and at 7pm. 
									I was feeling OK. But I'm overweight, I need to lose 5 kg to fight at super heavy weight next month. 
								</a>

							<h3>I donated bloody</h3>
							<p>
								<a>
									I donated blood this morning, that was a cool experience. But I didn't want to skip tje Jiu-Jitsu Class. I didn't go yesterday.
									That was a very tough training session. I felt tired and without energy. I hope I'll be on better conditions tomorrow.

							<h3>insomnia</h3>
							<p><a>I'm a little bit nervous about this project, so I couldn't sleep well for three consecutives days. 
								Because of this I didn't go to Jiu-Jitsu Class today. I'm feeling very tired. So I will rest this night.
							</a></p>

							<h3>a better day</h3>
							<p><a>I couldn't sleep well last night. Maybe because I started this project.
								But today was a good and funny day at work. I had some regular conversations with my co-workers
								 and everything was fine. I went to the Jiu-Jitsu gym after work today. It was a nogi session. 
								 And that was pretty tough. Maybe it was that tough because I couldn't sleep well.

							<h3>not a good wake up</h3>
							<p><a>Like every single Monday, that was not a good day at work. But was 
								a good day at English Class and when I arrived the 
								Jiu-Jitsu Class, everything goes fine. And I finaly start this blog. I don't know when
								I will upload this page, but I'm working on it.
